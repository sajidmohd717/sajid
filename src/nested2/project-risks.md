# Project Risks

- Senserbot Aurora
    - Current Aurora (Robotnik) not designed for unsupervised operations via RMF
    - Loaned Aurora units from PRL, to be assessed for clearing cargo lift gaps
(40mm x 10mm)
    - Senserbot in process of adopting Caato AMR design, may need some time to
complete the transition after the project
- Standard interfaces and AMR behavior
    - AMR Vendors have expressed unwillingness to make changes to existing
    product lines, especially to hardware
    - This will result in difficulty to standardize mapping services and docking
behaviors
- Current assessment
    - Moderate project risks (leading to subsequent operationalization)
    - Low technical risks
