## What is RMF@TRL?

RMF@TRL is a joint project by S&TPPO and GovTech, contributed by external collaborators: TBD

We are going to incorporate RMF into all the robots and facilities in TRL (Tampinies Regional Library). Along with that we aim to have a standardized safety standard for robots in the RMF ecosystem.
